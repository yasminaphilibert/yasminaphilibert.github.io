Pink clouds fold into themselves.
Threads of matter stretch, break, and return.
What we see is not form, but the moment before form disappears.

This work exists between image and sound.
A slow unfolding where color drifts like breath and movement listens to vibration.
The sound does not accompany the image — it opens space for it.

Matter floats as if weightless, suspended in a black field.
Each motion leaves a trace, then dissolves.
Nothing is stable long enough to become an object.

The image behaves like atmosphere.
The sound behaves like distance.
Together, they create a place that cannot be entered, only felt.

Ākāsadhātu is the element of space — not emptiness, but the field where everything briefly appears.
A place where matter forgets itself and returns to silence.

The video does not show.
It breathes.


Form appears, then remembers it was air.
