YΛSYNTHΛ - Love to Love You (Revisited)

NODALETO — Bulla Babies

This campaign is a film about desire in suspension.
Paint moves like smoke.
Color breathes, melts, and wraps the frame in slow motion — never settling, never stopping.

The shoe appears inside this flow, not as an object, but as a body.
It is touched by color, swallowed by it, revealed again.
The image is not about showing — it is about feeling.

Donna Summer’s Love to Love You Baby becomes a structure.
The rhythm stretches time.
The voice becomes liquid.
Sound and image fuse into the same gesture — sensual, obsessive, repetitive.

Paint behaves like breath.
Music behaves like skin.
The film becomes a loop where desire never resolves.

The camera lingers, not to explain, but to insist.
This is not a product moment.
It is a state.

A slow, intimate trance where color replaces touch,
and sound becomes the only way to see.

Optional closing line (perfect for campaign end card)

Desire has no beginning. Only a rhythm.
