YΛSYNTHΛ - Āpodhātu 

A Research Manifesto on Vibration

This project originates from a personal research into sound as a generative force.
Through cymatic experimentation, vibration is observed not as an effect, but as an origin — the moment where sound becomes form.

When sound enters water, matter responds.
Invisible waves organize themselves into structures, revealing rhythm, repetition, and order.
What appears abstract is in fact precise — governed by frequency and time.

This research is rooted in the observation of patterns repeating across all scales:
breath and waves, heartbeat and rhythm, micro-universe and cosmos.
Life reveals itself as vibration in motion.

In this work, sound and image are inseparable.
They are two expressions of the same phenomenon, one heard, the other revealed.
The forms are not designed — they emerge.

From Sound to Matter is a manifesto:
a declaration that what shapes matter also shapes us.

Sound is not what we hear.
It is what shapes.

Every form is born from vibration.
Chaque inspiration est la vie. Chaque expiration, la mort.
