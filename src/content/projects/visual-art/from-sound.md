Research on the Invisible

This project emerges from a personal research into the invisible forces that shape reality.
Using cymatic experimentation, I captured the propagation of sound as a visual experience — where vibration becomes matter.

Sound reveals itself as structure.
Each frequency generates its own geometry, each movement leaves a trace.
What is heard transforms into what is seen.

This research is rooted in the observation of repetitive patterns across all scales — from breath and heartbeat to waves and natural systems.
Nothing exists in isolation: rhythm governs life, form, and time.

In this work, sound and image are inseparable.
They are two states of the same phenomenon, emerging through resonance rather than control.

From Sound to Matter is an exploration of how the invisible organizes the visible — and how every form is born from vibration.
