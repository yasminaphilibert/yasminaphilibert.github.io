PRESSURE CORE explores matter at the moment of internal stress.

Rigid surfaces hold unstable interiors. Chrome shells contain soft, volatile substance tension exists not on the surface, but within. The object becomes a container of force, preserving a state that cannot remain stable indefinitely.

The forms appear frozen between integrity and collapse.
Between protection and exposure.

PRESSURE CORE examines material as a condition of compression where structure exists only as long as it can resist what it contains.
