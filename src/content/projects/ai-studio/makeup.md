SYNTHETIC PROTOCOL.EXE studies skin, hair, and makeup as engineered surfaces.

The skin is treated as a reflective material uniform, controlled, almost artificial. Light does not reveal imperfection; it confirms precision. Makeup is applied as structure, not expression. Pigment defines geometry, creating contrast between softness and synthetic clarity.

Hair becomes a constructed element. Glossy, sculptural forms wrap the head like designed extensions, existing between organic growth and manufactured object. They frame the face with intention, reinforcing the sense of a system rather than a natural state.

SYNTHETIC PROTOCOL.EXE presents beauty as a controlled condition where skin, hair, and makeup operate together as one continuous, designed surface.
