COMPLIANCE SIGNAL examines the smile as a programmed response.

The mouth becomes a visible output stretched, framed, and stabilized by external structures. Expression is no longer spontaneous. It is held in place, regulated, and maintained.

The smile exists as a surface instruction.
A signal of stability.
A confirmation of control.

COMPLIANCE SIGNAL isolates the moment where human expression stops being emotional and becomes functional a visible confirmation that the system is intact.
