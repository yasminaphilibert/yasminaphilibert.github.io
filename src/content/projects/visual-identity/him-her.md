ZADIG & VOLTAIRE
HIM & HER — The Hidden Bond

What appears as contrast is often the same origin, seen from different sides.
This project begins with a research discovery: sandalwood is the only molecule shared by both HIM and HER.
The sole point of contact. The silent bond.

From this, the packaging becomes a narrative of duality — not as opposition, but as coexistence.
Black and white no longer divide. They reveal.
HIM carries tension, impulse, and depth. HER holds clarity, light, and restraint.
Two bodies, one essence.

The design translates this research into form through a microscopic vision of sandalwood, embedded into the glass of the flacons.
A hidden micro-universe, usually perceived only through scent, is made visible — turning chemistry into emotion, science into poetry.

The bottles do not explain themselves immediately.
They ask to be discovered, just like identity itself.

What unites us is always hidden deeper than what separates us.
