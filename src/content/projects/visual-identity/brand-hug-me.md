Designing Comfort

HUG ME was born from the instinct to protect and reassure.
The initial idea of a hug evolved through research into the most primal bond: mother and child.

The symbol became the kangaroo, whose baby grows held close, inside a pouch, guided by warmth and heartbeat — a universal image of comfort and security.

Soft pastel colors express calm and tenderness.
The overlapping typography allows the letters to touch, visually recreating the gesture of a hug.

HUG ME is a promise of closeness, care, and warmth — designed to be felt before it is seen.
